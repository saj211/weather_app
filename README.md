# 🌤️ Weather App

A small weather app where you can search for a city and see the current weather + forecast.

Nothing crazy, just something I built while learning how to work with APIs and JavaScript.

## Features

* Search for a city
* See current weather info (temperature, wind, conditions, etc.)
* Switch between °C / °F and km/h / mph
* Change the day to view different forecasts
* Handles errors when the city isn’t found

## Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Open-Meteo API

## How to Run

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saj211/weather_app.git
```

Then just open `index.html` in your browser.

## What I Learned

* How to fetch and use API data
* Handling async code without breaking everything
* Updating the UI based on user input
* Debugging (a lot)

## Future Improvements

* Make the UI cleaner
* Add better loading states
* Maybe save previous searches
* Improve mobile layout

## Acknowledgment

Based on a Frontend Mentor challenge.
